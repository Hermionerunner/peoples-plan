This site is a collaborative effort to build a people's neighbourhood plan for North Horsham. You can edit any page, and make your own suggestions. You can also create new pages if you want to. It's a bit like a wiki, but with voting.

At the moment, the site is empty, but we can start adding the sections needed for a neighbourhood plan together.

## What is a neighbourhood plan?

From the [government website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/neighbourhood-planning--2):

> Neighbourhood planning gives communities direct power to develop a shared vision for their neighbourhood and shape the development and growth of their local area. They are able to choose where they want new homes, shops and offices to be built, have their say on what those new buildings should look like and what infrastructure should be provided, and grant planning permission for the new buildings they want to see go ahead. Neighbourhood planning provides a powerful set of tools for local people to ensure that they get the right types of development for their community where the ambition of the neighbourhood is aligned with the strategic needs and priorities of the wider local area.

> Neighbourhood planning provides the opportunity for communities to set out a positive vision for how they want their community to develop over the next 10, 15, 20 years in ways that meet identified local need and make sense for local people. They can put in place planning policies that will help deliver that vision or grant planning permission for the development they want to see
