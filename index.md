This site is a collaborative effort to build a people's plan for North Horsham. You can edit any page, and make your own suggestions. You can also create new pages if you want to. It's a bit like a wiki, but with voting.

At the moment, the site is empty, but we can start adding the sections needed for a parish plan together.

## How it works

* Anyone can edit a page - just click "suggest a change" in the top right.
* Once a suggestion is made, project contributors vote on whether or not it's accepted. Click "View proposals" above to see the current proposals.
* Once a proposal is accepted, the author gets to vote on future proposals.
